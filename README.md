# Server and Client System Configuration - Sentosa Hospital

This project involved configuring a Windows Server 2022 system and connecting it with a Windows 7 client to simulate an enterprise environment for Sentosa Hospital. The goal was to deploy core Windows Server services including Active Directory, DNS, Organization Units, User Management, Folder Permissions, Group Policies (GPOs), and a Web Server using IIS.

## Project Highlights
- Configured Windows Server roles and features.
- Deployed a DNS Server and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
- Created Organizational Units (OUs) and managed users.
- Set folder permissions through user roles.
- Applied Group Policies to enforce security settings.
- Installed and configured a Web Server using IIS.

## Tools Used
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 7 Ultimate
- Microsoft Word, Google Drive

## Key Outcomes

### 1. Computer Name and IP Configuration
Renamed the server's hostname to "Sentosa Group" and manually configured static IP addresses for both server and client to ensure stable network connectivity.

### 2. Active Directory and DNS Server Configuration
Installed and promoted the server to a Domain Controller. Set up DNS under the domain name `sentosahospital.com` for centralized domain management.

### 3. Organizational Units and User Management
Created Organizational Units (OUs) and added user accounts inside Active Directory. Users were assigned proper login credentials for accessing the domain network.

### 4. Client Machine Domain Join
Configured the Windows 7 client machine to join the `sentosahospital.com` domain. Verified domain join by logging in with Active Directory user accounts.

### 5. Folder Management and Permissions
Created shared folders on the server and assigned permission levels to specific users and groups via folder properties and security settings.

### 8. Group Policy Object (GPO) Implementation
Created and applied GPOs to enforce security policies, such as disabling shutdown options and hiding system folders on client machines. In this project, 
we removed the power off, shutdown, & restart signs. Then, we also removed Pictures & music from the 
menu.

### 9. Web Server (IIS) Setup
Installed Internet Information Services (IIS) on the server to host an internal hospital website, accessible by client machines via DNS. Edited the 
contents of the website page with HTML.
