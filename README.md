# Server and Client System Configuration - Sentosa Hospital

## Overview
This project involved configuring a Windows Server 2022 system and connecting it with a Windows 7 client to simulate an enterprise environment for Sentosa Hospital. The goal was to deploy core Windows Server services including Active Directory, DNS, Organization Units, User Management, Folder Permissions, Group Policies (GPOs), and a Web Server using IIS.

### 1. Computer Name and IP Configuration
Renamed the server's hostname to "Sentosa Group" and manually configured static IP addresses for both server and client to ensure stable network connectivity.

### 2. Active Directory and DNS Server Configuration
Installed and promoted the server to a Domain Controller. Set up DNS under the domain name `sentosahospital.com` for centralized domain management.

### 3. Organizational Units and User Management
Created Organizational Units (OUs) and added user accounts inside Active Directory. Users were assigned proper login credentials for accessing the domain network.

### 4. Client Machine Domain Join
Configured the Windows 7 client machine to join the `sentosahospital.com` domain. Verified domain join by logging in with Active Directory user accounts.

### 8. Group Policy Object (GPO) Implementation
Created and applied GPOs to enforce security policies, such as disabling shutdown options and hiding system folders on client machines.

### 9. Web Server (IIS) Setup
Installed Internet Information Services (IIS) on the server to host an internal hospital website, accessible by client machines via DNS.
